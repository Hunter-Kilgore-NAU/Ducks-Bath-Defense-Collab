# Description
Within our system, we have our game hosted on the Unity engine which allows players to survive waves of enemies in a tower defense game for as long as possible while increasing their scores to be uploaded.
Additionally, we have a remote database used for saving, storing, and displaying the high scores that players receive while playing the game.
Finally, all of these elements will be accessed through the website where users can view the leaderboard and play the game.
