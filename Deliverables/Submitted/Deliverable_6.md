# Introduction
Within our project, we wanted to appeal to the casual gamer market who are looking for quick, fun, and an easily accesible webpage based game.
Without the hassel of long downloads or microtransactions, its as simple as entering the website page and playing away!
We achieved this goal by adhering to our value proposition and researching the best features to implement that would best line up with our vision.
<br>
<br>
Gamers can expect to land on our website's homepage with a link to the game and leaderboard. 
The leaderboard is a simple database that shows a user's username, the score they ahchieved when playing, and the date it was achieved on in order to showcase high scores.
On the game page, the unity game itself is loaded in a window without the requirement of downloading anything or making an account.
The game is a relatively simple and easy to understand bath-themed tower defense game.
Players will be expected to defend their drain in the center of the map from an increasingly harder swarm of enemies coming from both ends of the map.
Defeating enemies with strategically placed towers will generate score and currency.
The currency is spent to purchase more towers and place them on the board from the shop UI which accurately displays price and places towers on the grid board.
Lastly, the score itself is to be submitted to the leaderboard page after the drain is defeated: prompting the user to insert a username.
<br>
<br>
All in all, the game is easy to understand and even easier to play.
The purpose of a simplistic gaming experience without any hassel of downloads long-winded learning curves that is easily accessible has been thouroghly achieved.
Gamers of all skill level can look forward to having fun in Ducks Bath Defense!

# Code Quality
Our team took to many preventative steps in order to ensure that code quality remained of a consistently good standard.
For starters, we hosted regular meetings throughout the week over Discord to get together and discuss activity on the project.
Additionally, we used Discord to collaborate any issues/questions we had regarding assigned portions.
Compatability between merges was maintained through constant collaboration via Discord.
<br>
<br>
GitHub proved highly effective when deciding to maintain code quality as it provided a medium for effective code sharing and merge compatability.
Issues for each section of code were creating in both Discord and GitHub as assigned individuals would adhere to the requirements found within.
Whenever a section of code would overlap with another individual's work, we would ensure that those involved individuals would then collaborate together and ensure that the code remained functional with the project as a whole.
<br>
<br>
As for the roles, the Scrum Master would host meetings with everyone involved and determine what sections of code needed working on and who would work on them.
Additionally, cross work was allowed and encouraged in order for all individuals had an opportunity to help contribute.
The Product Owner would determine the best tools for success in different sections of the project and relay them to the Scrum Master to utilize in consideration of meetings and task delegation.
Lastly, the Archivist would ensure quality of records of coded sections prior to the final review of the Scrum Master.
<br>
<br>
All together, our group played our parts to ensure that each of our contributions would adhere to the larger picture and uphold our class' standard software engineering.
With all contributions playing an important role, our maintained code quality proved most effective in the development process.

# Lessons Learned
In the end, our team learned a great deal about software engineering and project development as a whole.
We learned to effectively communicate between our team members, how to split a large project into smaller and easily digestable portions, how to plan the steps ahead in advance, and how to effectively utilize roles in the creation process.
That is to say we did not have our issues along the way as well.
Due to our initial difficulty of understanding the expected progress to be made, we did not get to add as many Non-MVP requirements as we would have liked.
Additionally, after some initial issues, our team has learned to be extremely effective with working with one another.
Had we more time to continue development, we could've added new enemy and tower types, sound effects, music, and more general quality of life improvements to the game as a whole.
<br>
<br>
In the end our team has come out the other side better than before. 
As a first time experience developing such a large scale project together, we have begun to finally earn that much-needed experience in the field of software engineering.
