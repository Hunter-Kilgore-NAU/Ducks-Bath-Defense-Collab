# Description
Within our project, we wanted to appeal to the casual gamer market who are looking for a quick, fun, and easily accesible webpage-based game.
Without the hassle of long downloads or microtransactions, its as simple as entering the website page and playing away!
We achieved this goal by adhering to our value proposition and researching the best features to implement that would best line up with our vision.
<br>
<br>
Gamers can expect to land on our website's homepage with a link to the game and leaderboard. 
The leaderboard is a simple database that shows a user's username, the score they achieved when playing, and the date it was achieved on in order to showcase high scores.
On the game page, the unity game itself is loaded in a window without the requirement of downloading anything or making an account.
The game is a relatively simple and easy to understand bath-themed tower defense game.
Players will be expected to defend their drain in the center of the map from an increasingly harder swarm of enemies coming from both ends of the map.
Defeating enemies with strategically placed towers will generate score and currency.
The currency is spent to purchase more towers and place them on the board from the shop UI which accurately displays price and places towers on the grid board.
Lastly, the score itself is to be submitted to the leaderboard page after the drain is defeated: prompting the user to insert a username.
<br>
<br>
All in all, the game is easy to understand and even easier to play.
The purpose of a simplistic gaming experience without any hassle of downloading long-winded learning curves that are easily accessible has been thoroughly achieved.
Gamers of all skill levels can look forward to having fun in Ducks Bath Defense!

**Questions Asked:**
<br>
**Q.** What are your initial thoughts of our webpage?
<br>
**A.** Very simple, but it gets the point across that it is a game.
<br>
**Q.** Do you like being able to view the highscores of other players?
<br>
**A.** Yes, it is very nice, well organized
<br>
**Q.** What do you prefer, downloading games or having them web hosted? Why?
<br>
**A.** I don’t mind either or, just depends on the game itself
<br>
**Q.** What are your initial thoughts of the game itself?
<br>
**A.** Slightly confusing initially, took a bit to figure out what to do, since I thought I should put the towers on the water. Other than that, I enjoy it, it's silly and reminds me of older games.
<br>
**Q.** Is there any features you wish were included? If so, which features?
<br>
**A.** Something that would be nice is instructions on how to play the game whether that be a new text box or maybe a little intro before the game progresses. This could be easily put on the front of the webpage. The other is just the character box since it didn’t work with mobile, but that’s okay. I think another little stylistic edit would be to make the water move instead of the outside area because it made it look like the land was the water and the blue was the trail. Another thing I would add is where you can or can’t place items. It’s hard to tell.
<br>
**Q.** How would you rate your skill in gaming?
<br>
**A.** Within the game, I was a little lost at first, but I think I was able to figure it out and create a defense system. Could be better, but this is just the first time playing it. 
<br>
**Q.** Does the game seem too difficult, easy, or just right for your level of skill?
<br>
**A.** I think this game is right if not a little easy which isn’t bad at all. I’ve played a tower defense game in the past thus why it is a little easy for me. 
<br>
**Q.** Do you have any closing thoughts or remarks?
<br>
**A.** Great game! I loved the little sprites of ducks and frogs fighting each other. Fun to play and it is just a relaxing game. I could see the potential of this game becoming something more. I also love that the ducks move around after they defeat you. 
<br>
<br>
**Summary of Interview:**
It seems that the game itself works fine and is pretty easy, however, it seems there are some glitches on certain platforms such as buttons not being pressed or the keyboard not popping up. It seems to be enjoyable to the user despite these things.
