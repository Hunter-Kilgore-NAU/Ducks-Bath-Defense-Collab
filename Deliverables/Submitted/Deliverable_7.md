# Description
Within our project, we wanted to appeal to the casual gamer market who are looking for quick, fun, and an easily accesible webpage based game.
Without the hassel of long downloads or microtransactions, its as simple as entering the website page and playing away!
We achieved this goal by adhering to our value proposition and researching the best features to implement that would best line up with our vision.

<br>
Gamers can expect to land on our website's homepage with a link to the game and leaderboard. 
The leaderboard is a simple database that shows a user's username, the score they ahchieved when playing, and the date it was achieved on in order to showcase high scores.
On the game page, the unity game itself is loaded in a window without the requirement of downloading anything or making an account.
The game is a relatively simple and easy to understand bath-themed tower defense game.
Players will be expected to defend their drain in the center of the map from an increasingly harder swarm of enemies coming from both ends of the map.
Defeating enemies with strategically placed towers will generate score and currency.
The currency is spent to purchase more towers and place them on the board from the shop UI which accurately displays price and places towers on the grid board.
Lastly, the score itself is to be submitted to the leaderboard page after the drain is defeated: prompting the user to insert a username.
<br>
<br>
All in all, the game is easy to understand and even easier to play.
The purpose of a simplistic gaming experience without any hassel of downloads long-winded learning curves that is easily accessible has been thouroghly achieved.
Gamers of all skill level can look forward to having fun in Ducks Bath Defense!
