Customer Segment:

H: Good morning! I’m currently trying to gather research for a project I’m working on and I was hoping to speak with you for a few minutes about it if you’re available.
T: Sure, what do you need to talk about?
H: Well, firstly, do you play any games often?
T: Yeah, all the time.
H: What kind of games would you say that you play?
T: Mostly shooters and cooperative games. Sometimes party games with friends.
H: Would you say you’re interested in other kinds of games as well or just those?
T: I mainly play those, but I’m always interested in playing other types of games if they look interesting enough.
H: That’s good to hear. Is there anything you’ve seen about new games you might’ve tried that deterred you from playing them?
T: All the time! I hate it when games monetize themselves too much or are too complicated to get into.
H: So would you say that you would be interested in trying a new game you don’t play very often if they addressed those issues?
T: Maybe, it depends on how the game looks and plays but it’d be easier to get into for sure.
H: Well, in our project, we’re developing a Tower Defense game with the main idea behind it being accessible to a wide audience. It would be a browser game so no downloads are necessary while also making sure it's uncomplicated to play and unobtrusive with monetization. Does that interest you?
T: I’ve never been that big on Tower Defense games but I’d be willing to try it for a while if all I had to do was go to the website.
H: Thank you for taking the time to answer my questions! Your responses were most helpful!


Key insights: 

The interviewed individual expressed a strong desire to try new games but also being easily deterred from trying games outside of his normal area of play due to intrusive features commonly seen in the gaming industry.

H: Good morning! I’m currently trying to gather research for a project I’m working on and I was hoping to speak with you for a few minutes about it if you’re available.
A: Yeah I’ve got some time as long as it's not very long.
H: Thanks! It won’t take long! Would you say you’re someone who plays games very often?
A: Not as much as I used to since starting university. I just don’t have as much free time.
H: What game genres do you, or used to, play?
A: I liked simulator games, things for construction, farming, and cleaning.
H: What did you enjoy most about those games?
A: I just enjoyed being able to sit down and play something super easy to pick up and put down. It was relaxing.
H: Would you be willing to play a new game if it was also easy to pick up and put down? Where starting and stopping are simple?
A: Yeah, especially now where my schedule is so erratic.
H: What would deter you from playing a game like that?
A: If it was too time consuming or too complicated to understand quickly. If it's a hassle, I just wouldn’t play it.
H: I’m currently working on a game project that is a Tower Defense game designed to be as accessible as possible! You’d be able to start and stop whenever you wanted as all you’d have to do is go onto the website and play for however long you want! With no downloads necessary, you can start playing immediately!
A: That seems perfect! Is it complicated to understand?
H: No, it aligns with your preferences of easy gameplay that you can do to relax! Much like the simulator games you enjoy!
A: Yeah! That would be amazing for me! I’d love to play it when I have free time between work loads!
