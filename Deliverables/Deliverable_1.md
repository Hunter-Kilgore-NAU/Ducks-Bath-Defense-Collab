**Customer Segment:**

H: Good morning! I’m currently trying to gather research for a project I’m working on and I was hoping to speak with you for a few minutes about it if you’re available.<br>
T: Sure, what do you need to talk about?<br>
H: Well, firstly, do you play any games often?<br>
T: Yeah, all the time.<br>
H: What kind of games would you say that you play?<br>
T: Mostly shooters and cooperative games. Sometimes party games with friends.<br>
H: Would you say you’re interested in other kinds of games as well or just those?<br>
T: I mainly play those, but I’m always interested in playing other types of games if they look interesting enough.<br>
H: That’s good to hear. Is there anything you’ve seen about new games you might’ve tried that deterred you from playing them?<br>
T: All the time! I hate it when games monetize themselves too much or are too complicated to get into.<br>
H: So would you say that you would be interested in trying a new game you don’t play very often if they addressed those issues?<br>
T: Maybe, it depends on how the game looks and plays but it’d be easier to get into for sure.<br>
H: Well, in our project, we’re developing a Tower Defense game with the main idea behind it being accessible to a wide audience. It would be a browser game so no downloads are necessary while also making sure it's uncomplicated to play and unobtrusive with monetization. Does that interest you?<br>
T: I’ve never been that big on Tower Defense games but I’d be willing to try it for a while if all I had to do was go to the website.<br>
H: Thank you for taking the time to answer my questions! Your responses were most helpful!<br>
