# Contributing
When contributing, please ensure that the change is discussed first before making it.
## Pull Request Process
1. If you include a new build in your pull request, ensure that it is stable (i.e. suitable for the main branch), otherwise, leave the build how you found it.
2. Update the README.md file to show the version number your pull request would represent, as well as add any other appropriate content.
3. For pull requests having to do with deliverables or other non-source code related items, request a review from the **Archivist.** If your pull request includes source code, request a review from the **Scrum Master.** You may also add additional reviewers as you see fit.
4. You may merge your pull request once you have approval from either the **Archivist** or **Scrum Master,** whoever is assigned to review it.
